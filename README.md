# responsiveDesign
i'll create a partial replica of apple's website using html and css which was redesigned for the launch of the new iPhone 11 pro. i'll add several animations, including the use of keyframes, and we will also make the website responsive. That's a prototype for my social project from my college (Vinculacion con la Sociedad)
